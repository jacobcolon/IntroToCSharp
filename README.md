# November 2018 - Introduction to C# - You had me at "Hello World": Hands on Lab

Never programmed before? This is your class. No experience with C#? This is your class. Can’t decide what class to attend? This is probably your class. This session is designed for very beginner programmers, as we won’t be rushing through code. In the first half of the session, we will be focusing on learning about the CLR and .Net framework.
